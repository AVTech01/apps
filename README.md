To make this task easier, we took some time to write this documents to show you how smoothly is to make beautiful Apps and publish them on all your players around the world.

First of all we would like you to know how to [create your own OnSign TV Apps](docs). There are sections explaining how the Apps are [structured](docs#creating-your-own-onsign-tv-apps); How to give your end-user [flexibility and control](docs#app-configuration) when using your creation; A [list of `<meta> tag` types](docs#available-app-configuration-types) and a section for [available utilities](docs#available-utilities), to let you more in control.

Second, we would like to ease your entrance into the world of App creation showing [codified samples](samples) of some of our most used Apps. This document shows the appearance of them along a small description of what they can do with access to all the code you need to make them work. [Check how the App above was created](samples/weather/weather-forecast-horizontal-bar/app.html).

Hope you have a good time and enjoy being creative with our platform. Cheers!
